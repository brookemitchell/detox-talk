# Days of drama 🙁

<Appear> <li> App Release Day 🌊🌩 </li> </Appear>

<!-- Image of apple store submission -->

```notes
- I want to tell you what used to be the most trying days at work (Press Down) - App submission day
- Once I used to keep a long boring checklist of things to do before an app store submission.
- Test login, send a reply, create a notification, open a dynamic link.
- It was time consuming and could easily take a day or two.
- You've also had the experience of nervousness as to whether you new 'feature' is really a regression.
- And have felt the anxiety of an App Store release that passed review, but broke core some core piece of functionality.
- I have done all those things.
- This talk is about showing you the steps you can take to relax a little,
- I'll tell you the most important thing about making sure your app survives constant change
- Right now I'll often update an app multiple times a day without much drama.
- One of ways to do that is:

# Detox your apps ☣

<Appear>
	<h1> Explore your apps 🗺  </h1>
</Appear>

```notes
- This is a talk about using a tools name detox to end to end test your react native applications
- Talk is called `Detox your apps` - That isn't the greatest name for a talk.
- Why? 1st Because no one should consider their app toxic.
- 2nd no one tool will save you from the messiness of writing a real app. Trust me.
- I will tell you some of the best ways to use this tool to save your app from missing functionality
- 2nd testing tools like this will help you to automating much more of your app delivery process. But thats another talk.
- More appropriate talk title is - It's time to deeply explore the critical path of your app from a users point of view
- Which isn't the greatest name, so we'll just stick with detox your apps

```notes
- Here is an excellent piece of branding that looks nothing like the way way really work.
	- Don't worry we dont really sit that close together
- I've been writing react native for about 2 years.
- We develop a mobile app that lets account manager check their surveys, get alerts and respond from mobile
- Here is a quick demo of one of the detox test runs
- Unfortunately its probably best that I show an approved video of this,
  	- Incase I accedentailly tab into a part of the code base labelled 'super secret new feature'
- We'll try running a live demo of detox later in the talk.
	- Which for anyone that worked with previous end to end testing tools is pretty daring
- Here is a sneek peek of one of our end to end test suites running -> show ask nicely demo video
- So what's going on here? That brings us to this talk

# Pyramid of boredom 😪

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/detox-talk/testing_pyramid.png)

```notes
		- Pyramid of boredom
		- Part of the late popularity of this idea. is back in 2012 google put up a blog post that the optimum ratio of unit/Integration/e2e is 70%/20%/10%
		- There is some disagreement, but it is a good idea to avoid getting stuck doing too much in e2e tests
		- Dont have time to really go into it here, but a tool like detox is never going to be fast,
			- it can be a lot less painful to use than other e2e testing.
			- Anyone thats tried some popular solutions for web testing knows how painful it can be
