# Detox your apps ☣

<Appear> <h1> Explore your apps 🗺  </h1> </Appear>

```notes
- This is a talk about using a tools name detox to end to end test your react native applications
- Talk is called `Detox your apps` - That isn't the greatest name for a talk.
- Why? 1st Because no one should consider their app toxic.
- 2nd no one tool will save you from the messiness of writing a real app. Trust me.
- I will tell you some of the best ways to use this tool to save your app from missing functionality
- 2nd testing tools like this will help you to automating much more of your app delivery process. But thats another talk.
- More appropriate talk title is - It's time to deeply explore the critical path of your app from a users point of view
- Which isn't the greatest name, so we'll just stick with detox your apps

```notes
- I work for a company called AskNicely. We make customer experience software.
- I've been writing react native for about 2 years.
- We develop a mobile app that lets account manager check their surveys, get alerts and respond from mobile
- Here is a quick demo of one of the detox test runs
- Unfortunately its probably best that I show an approved video of this, incase I accedentailly tab into a part of the code base labelled 'super secret new feature'
- So what's going on here? That brings us to this talk
